## Project 1 - House Price Prediction
In this project I have used two models for predicting prices of house depending upon various factors. First one is Linear Regression and second one is Random Forest model.
Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent variables (also called predictors or features) and the dependent variable (also called the target or response variable).
A Random Forest model is a popular ensemble learning method used in machine learning for both regression and classification tasks. It belongs to the family of decision tree-based models and is known for its high performance and robustness.
In the end we can see that the Random forest model had a higher rate of accuracy as compared to Linear Regression Model.

## Project 2 - Movie Recommendation System
The movie recommendation system in machine learning (ML) aims to predict the preferences of users for movies based on their past interactions, such as ratings or viewing history, as well as the preferences of similar users. 
These systems typically employ various ML algorithms to analyze patterns in the data and make predictions about which movies a user might like.

## Project 3 - Iris Flower Classification
The "iris flower classification" problem is a classic example in machine learning, often used for introductory tutorials and demonstrations. 
The goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica, based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
